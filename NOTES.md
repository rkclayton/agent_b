# Implementation notes

## Prompt 1 assumptions and deviations

- acme is the target serving machine. Work was performed remotely over Tailscale and Windows OpenSSH because the repository workspace is on another Windows machine.
- `E:\llama` and `E:\Models` replace the documented `C:` defaults because `C:` had insufficient room for the 13.1 GB model while `E:` had about 471 GB free.
- llama.cpp `b10775` was the newest official build release with Windows CUDA artifacts at installation time. The CUDA 13.3 bundle was selected because Blackwell requires CUDA 12.8 or newer; direct device discovery and inference verified compatibility with driver 591.86.
- The exact model download was `hf download unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q3_K_XL.gguf --local-dir E:\Models\Qwen3.8-27B`. The MTP draft was downloaded separately only after baseline passed.
- Rung 1 was skipped because the RTX 5070 Ti drives the display. The required near-margin retry of rung 2 used `-ot token_embd.weight=CPU`; it did not restore the margin and is off by default.
- MTP improved decode by more than 20% and retained valid tool calls, but its 205 MiB remaining VRAM violated the safety margin. The files and switch remain available for later testing; the default is off.
- No prescribed flag was rejected. No context-shift, cache-reuse, chat-template default, reasoning-budget, or checkpoint flag was added.
- Ollama 0.23.2 was running, but `/api/tags`, `/api/ps`, `D:\AI\models\manifests`, and `D:\AI\models\blobs` were empty. Therefore its prior effective context is recorded as unknown.
- Anonymous Pollinations endpoints returned 401/402 and were rejected as a public-provider candidate. Ollama Cloud was reachable but returned 401 until the desktop app is signed in; no credential was stored.
- The shell account and SSH keys are operational access only. They are excluded by `.gitignore` and never appear in tracked files.

## Operational cautions

- `llama-server` intentionally has no API key because it binds only to `127.0.0.1`. Use SSH forwarding for remote API access; do not expose port 8080 directly to the LAN or tailnet without authentication.
- The shell tool built later is not a security boundary. The workspace must remain disposable, commands are logged, and OS-level isolation is deferred as specified in `INTERFACES.md`.

## Prompt 2

- The permanent reliability canary uses Go 1.27.1. The official portable Windows archive was installed under `E:\tools\go` on acme because the MSI path was blocked by local execution policy; no Python is used by the canary or its runner.
- C1 (`UD-Q3_K_XL`, 32K) and C2 (`UD-IQ4_XS`, 16K) each passed 6/6 trials. The prescribed tie rule retains C1. C2 loaded with `--fit off` and did not need partial offload.
- C2 was downloaded directly from `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF` with `curl` and is 14,252,845,984 bytes. The end-to-end runner wall time was 18.51 minutes, of which about 15.8 minutes was the 13.27 GiB download.
- The final C1 rerun passed canaries 1, 2, and 8 at 32,768 context: health HTTP 200, overflow HTTP 400, 1,729.75 prompt tok/s, and 50.27 generated tok/s.
