# AgentB

AgentB is a small, standard-library Go coding-agent harness for OpenAI-compatible model servers. It provides observable multi-session runs, seven guarded workspace tools, exact-or-labeled context accounting, compaction, durable workspace notes, a console UI, and a standalone chat window.

## Run

On the verified Windows host, start the pinned local model with `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\serve\start.ps1`. Adjust the script parameters if llama.cpp or the GGUF lives elsewhere. Then start AgentB from the repository root:

```text
go run ./cmd/harness -config harness.json
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8790/` for the instrument or `http://127.0.0.1:8790/chat?session=main` for chat. `serve/chat-window.ps1 main` or `serve/chat-window.sh main` launches Chrome/Edge in a 520×760 app window when available and otherwise opens the normal browser.

Replay one or more session logs without loading a model or enabling mutations:

```text
go run ./cmd/harness -config harness.json -replay logs/main.jsonl,logs/s2.jsonl
```

Profiles hold the endpoint, model, sampling, reasoning, context, and probe results. The settings sheet can add, duplicate, edit, test, and remove profiles; full probes measure behavior while minimal/off modes label assumptions. A profile is runnable only with known context, streaming, structured tool calls, and non-truncating overflow behavior.

Sessions are ephemeral views onto a workspace and may use different profiles. Point several sessions at one workspace for a swarm; file-write conflicts force a re-read instead of silently overwriting another session. AgentB schedules two runs by default, but the verified llama.cpp server uses `--parallel 1`, so local generation interleaves rather than decoding two requests simultaneously.

## Configuration

| Area | Keys |
|---|---|
| Process | `listen`, `workspace`, `log_dir` |
| Profiles | `servers[].{id,label,base_url,model,api_key,request_timeout_s,probe_mode,sampling,reasoning,context,system_prompt_override,capabilities}` |
| Runs | `run.{max_turns,cycle_window,max_consecutive_tool_errors,max_concurrent,queue_depth}`, `approval.mode` |
| Context and memory | `context.{soft_pct,summary_pct,accounting}`, `memory.{enabled,dir,max_tokens}` |
| Tool caps | `tools.{read_file,list_dir,grep}`, `shell.{command,timeout_s,max_timeout_s,max_output_lines_head,max_output_lines_tail,deny}` |

See [web/DESIGN.md](web/DESIGN.md) for the UI contract, [INTERFACES.md](INTERFACES.md) for events and APIs, and [SERVING.md](SERVING.md) for the verified model host. Replace any file in `web/assets/` to change the artwork; nothing else references it.

## Deferred boundaries

- OS-level shell sandboxing; the current jail, deny list, approvals, and process-tree timeout are not a security boundary.
- API authentication. AgentB intentionally binds loopback; an EventSource query-string token was rejected because it leaks through logs/history without addressing a present network threat. Authentication must be designed when `listen` moves off loopback.
- MCP tools and the Discord process. The two Discord integration hooks are the existing `/api/message` plus SSE client surface, and `run.queue_depth`/`message.queued` for chat backpressure; no bot process is included.
- Session persistence across restarts and orchestration or handoff between sessions.
- Electron/Tauri packaging, image input, and a second local `--parallel 2` server slot.
